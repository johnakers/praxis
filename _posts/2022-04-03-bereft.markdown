Bereft, is a concept for a game I came up with, many years ago, while chatting with [Matthew LoPresti](https://twitter.com/Cronotriggers).
I haven't done any game dev in the past few years, and I figured its time to get back into it. After
an exploratory period of "Do I want to make this 2D? 3D?", and then tinkering with some tutorials for
Godot's 2D workflow (which is pretty great), I decided to go with Unity, and 3D. I decided this as the
ecosystem, and resources, are quite plentiful, and 3D is something I've wanted to pursue for a while.

Being a former game reviewer, and now software engineer, I know this project will take some time, and
one could almost consider it more of an experience I'm working on, rather than a game, as it will be
quite short in nature, but hopefully dense with content.

I'm a fan of the Dishonored, and BioShock series. In conjunction, the aesthetic of the Alien universe
is one I'm fond of as well. I most definitely want to keep the scope of this project small, but taking
some narrative elements from those series (such as the villian behind the wall), and trying my hand at
a sci-fi universe, is something I feel I can achieve.

This past night, I've been using Unity's SNAPs and made a brief attempt at the Asset Swap Tool, but it
looks like there's a bug in that and admittedly didn't feel like debugging on it, right now.

Additionally, this game is something I can blog about more, and my Unity learnings.
