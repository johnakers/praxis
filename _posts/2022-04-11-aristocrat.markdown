excerpt: "A short story, set in the world of Dishonored..."

[Aristocrat](https://johnakers.net/aristocrat), is a short story, told through the journal of Rhys
Haley. For all intents and purposes, he is a schoolboy. He comes across a girl, who is not all she
seems, and some form of a plot, ensues.

It is set in the world of Dishonored, but extremely tangential. Unless you're a big fan of the series,
like myself, it may not even come across as a "fan fiction".

Just through moving computers, computers getting water spilt on them, and so forth, it looks as though
I've lost some of the tail end of the Rhys' journal. Perhaps I should leave it that way?

This is actually something I wrote a few years ago, and figured it was time to "officially" put it back
on the internet.
