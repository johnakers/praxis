excerpt: "Level prototyping in Sketchup"
---

In Bereft, the level the player starts in, I'm calling "cells". A quick prototype is below, made in
Sketchup. There was a K-2SO model, which I'm using to represent the robot.

Sketchup hasn't changed too much over the years, and I think still a great tool for quickly making
something. I had used in my Construction Management days, briefly, and it works well for game levels
as well.

I plan to make this, as its to scale, using SNAPS in Unity and perhaps [this pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-level-kit-aaa-urp-174900), by Black Cloud Studios. I am hesitant,
as the game they released, received less than stellar reviews, [after a turbulent Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blackcloudstudios/after-reset-rpg-rebooted), and [Steam release](https://store.steampowered.com/app/335850/After_Reset_RPG/). But, if the pack is good, then I'm sure it'll work great.
