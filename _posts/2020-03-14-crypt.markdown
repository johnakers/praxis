[Crypt](https://johnakers.net/crypt) is a small weekend hack. It procedurally generates tiny dungeons.

<!-- has to be a better way -->

The way I figured it was, create a floor grid of rooms. Each room has a type, which may or may not have
enemies, or rewards. Additionally, each side of the room may have a door. If it does, connect it to
the other room. Its written in hacky JavaScript, and desperately needs a refactor. It has a downloadable
JSON file as well, though it does need a small rework.

I am trying to, slowly, get back into hobby game development (as well as writing), and the idea of
a small little sci-fi or medieval rogue-like, with random levels, is a fun idea.
